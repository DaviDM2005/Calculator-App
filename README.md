# Kotlin Calculator App

## Alert: The application is under development. You may encounter some bugs while using it!




## Welcome to the Kotlin Calculator App repository! This simple calculator app is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Feel free to explore the source code and make any improvements or modifications.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the calculator app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Android Studio
https://developer.android.com/studio

- Kotlin Plugin for Android Studio

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaviDM2005/Calculator-App.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Decimal point support
- Clear button to reset the input
- Equal button to calculate the result

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device or emulator.

2. Input numbers and perform operations using the provided buttons.

3. Press the equal button to see the result of the calculation.

4. Use the clear button to reset the input and start a new calculation.

## Code Overview

The main functionality of the app is implemented in the `MainActivity` class, which handles button clicks and performs arithmetic operations. The XML layout file (`activity_main.xml`) defines the user interface elements.

Key methods in `MainActivity`:

- `onDigit(view: View)`: Appends the clicked digit to the input text.
- `onClear(view: View)`: Clears the input text.
- `onDecimalPoint(view: View)`: Appends a decimal point to the input text.
- `onOperator(view: View)`: Appends the clicked operator to the input text.
- `onEqual(view: View)`: Calculates the result of the expression.
